# gameoflife

**gameoflife** is a Conway's game of life implementation for Arduino and a MAX7219 controlled 8x8 led matrix.

It has been developed in a single day and doesn't have any fancy options. *It just works*

## How to use it

It's easy to get it working. Connect your led matrix to the apropiate pins on Arduino and load the sketch on it.

The program starts with a glider crossing the screen. After that, the grid is initializated with random values that develop until:

 * all cells die.
 * system is frozen.
 * or has grown for 50 generations.

Then a new random matrix is generated and the cycle begins again.
